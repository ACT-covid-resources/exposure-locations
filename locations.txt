    Casual contact exposure locations in the ACT

    If you have been to any of the following locations at the dates and times specified, you must:

      * complete the ACT Contact Declaration Form
      * immediately quarantine
      * get tested for COVID-19 as advised by ACT Health:
              o If you were at the casual contact location less than 4 days ago, you will need two tests. You need to get a test as soon as you find out you are a casual contact.
